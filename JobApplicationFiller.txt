Automated Job Application Filler Project

Project Overview

You're looking to create a tool (Chrome extension and/or macOS application) that automatically fills job application forms using information from your CV/resume and other pre-fed data, potentially enhanced with AI capabilities.
Key Technologies Needed
Core Technologies

    Frontend Options:

        Chrome Extension: HTML, CSS, JavaScript + Chrome APIs

        macOS Native App: Swift/SwiftUI or Electron (for cross-platform)

    Backend/Processing:

        PDF parsing (for CV extraction): PyPDF2, pdf.js, or Apache Tika

        Form detection & filling: Puppeteer (for web), AppleScript (for macOS apps)

    Data Storage:

        Local storage (Chrome Storage API, SQLite)

        Optional cloud sync (Firebase, AWS S3)

AI Integration Options

    Natural Language Processing:

        OpenAI API, Anthropic, or local models (LLaMA, Mistral)

        For understanding job descriptions and tailoring responses

    Computer Vision:

        Tesseract OCR (for non-text fields in applications)

        OpenCV (for form field detection)

    Matching Algorithms:

        Semantic similarity (Sentence Transformers, spaCy)

        Keyword extraction (RAKE, YAKE)

Additional Useful Technologies

    Browser Automation: Playwright, Selenium

    Resume Parsing: Affinda API, Sovren, or custom NLP solution

    Template Matching: For recognizing common application forms

    Job Platform APIs: LinkedIn API, Greenhouse, Lever (where available)

Implementation Considerations

    Security: Secure storage for personal data

    Customization: Allow user to edit field mappings

    Adaptability: Handle different form structures

    User Experience: Easy profile setup and management
